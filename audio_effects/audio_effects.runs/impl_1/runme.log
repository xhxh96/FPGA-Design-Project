WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net p_down1/clk_read is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin p_down1/memory_reg_i_1/O, cell p_down1/memory_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT p_down1/memory_reg_i_1 is driving clock pin of 11 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    p_down1/j_reg_rep[0] {FDRE}
    p_down1/j_reg_rep[1] {FDRE}
    p_down1/j_reg_rep[2] {FDRE}
    p_down1/j_reg_rep[3] {FDRE}
    p_down1/j_reg_rep[4] {FDRE}
